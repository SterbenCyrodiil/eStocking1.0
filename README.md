# eStocking1.0
One of the first projects I had in Java

The project is a bit messy but fully functional. It doesn't have a good structure, which I shall create and add in order to make a better software, if not only for the experience gained in supporting old software. If possible (due to college time constraints), I pretend to had a XML parser and a REST API
It involved messing around with SQL too. For that I used PostgreSQL and I designed the Database myself, which is currently requirind a bit of work in order to optamize it according to standart rules of the relation model.
